# Assignment 3
## Framing-
ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data.

#### 1. Training
We feed in the labelled data for the model to learn the relationship between the features and labels. 
#### 2. Inference
The data fed to the model is inferred and useful predictions are made based on the relationships deribed from the training data set.

## Descending into ML:
###Linear Regression
Data given to us can plotted and a straight line can be drawn where not all the points pass through all the points but substantially many points. . Using the equation for a line, you could write down this relationship as follows:
#### y'= w1x1 + b
1. y'= is the predicted label (a desired output)
2. b = is the bias (the y-intercept), sometimes referred to as w
3. w1 = is the weight of feature 1. Weight is the same concept as the "slope" m in the traditional equation of a line
4. x1 = is a feature (a known input)

Although this model uses only one feature, a more sophisticated model might rely on multiple features, each having a separate weight (w1, w2, etc.). For example, a model that relies on three features might look as follows:
#### y'= b + w1x1 + w2x2
