## Framing-
ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data.

#### 1. Training
We feed in the labelled data for the model to learn the relationship between the features and labels. 

#### 2. Inference
The data fed to the model is inferred and useful predictions are made based on the relationships deribed from the training data set.
