## Problem 1:

### Conclusions
####Challenge 1:

1. -Min AveMonthSpend = 22
   -Max AveMonthSpend = 176
   -Mean AveMonthSpend = 72.39
   -Median AveMonthSpend = 68
   -SD AveMonthSpend = 27.26
2. More customers have not bought bikes.
3. Median yearly income is as follows: Management > Professional > Skilled Manual > Clerical > Manual Occupation
4. Customers with no children at home have a lower median AvgMonthSpend values than customers with one or more children at home.

7. Male customers are more likely to buy bikes than female customers.
8. Median yearly income is higher for customers who bought a bike.
9. The code for this project is in Problem-1.ipynb
10. The values of AveMonthSpend that I get by running my model on the test dataset is there in Problem-1.csv.
##Problem-2
In this the code for training the model is in train.py. The inital notebook wehere I have printed some stats and had written the code for traing the model is problem-2.ipynb.
