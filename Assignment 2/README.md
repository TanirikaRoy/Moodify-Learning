## Problem 1:

### Conclusions
#### Challenge 1:

1. -Min AveMonthSpend = 22
   -Max AveMonthSpend = 176
   -Mean AveMonthSpend = 72.39
   -Median AveMonthSpend = 68
   -SD AveMonthSpend = 27.26
2. More customers have not bought bikes.
3. Median yearly income is as follows: Management > Professional > Skilled Manual > Clerical > Manual Occupation
4. Customers with no children at home have a lower median AvgMonthSpend values than customers with one or more children at home.

6. Male customers have a higher median AvgMonthSpend than female customers.
7. Male customers are more likely to buy bikes than female customers.
8. Median yearly income is higher for customers who bought a bike.
9. The code for this project is in Problem-1.ipynb
10. The values of AveMonthSpend that I get by running my model on the test dataset is there in Problem-1.csv. <br/>
## Problem-2
Trained the model and used the test data to test it.
